- 👋 Hi, I’m @andersonkd
- 👀 I’m interested in changing careers to a computer science based field, specifically project management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software engineering, c++, python, html, css, django, github and just about anything I have the time to dabble with.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything as long as I can make a little extra time.
- 📫 How to reach me email: kdande15@louisville.edu
